**Class:** IT 485 Capstone
**Project Name:** Pawsome Pets

**Overview:**
Pawsome Pets is a collaborative project undertaken as part of the IT 485 Capstone class. Our team, comprising four members including myself, aimed to develop a web application leveraging the capabilities of the Petfinder API.

**Project Details:**
The core functionality of Pawsome Pets revolves around enabling users to search for adoptable pets within a 100-mile radius of a specified zip code. Our web application offers a user-friendly query interface with filters including postal code, state, type of pet, gender, age, size, and sorting options.

**Features:**

_1. Comprehensive Search:_ Users can search for various types of pets including dogs, cats, rabbits, small & furry animals, horses, birds, creatures with scales, fins & others, and barnyard animals.

_2. Detailed Information: _ Upon querying, the application retrieves information about the pets, including their photo, name, gender, age, a brief description, compatibility with dogs, cats, and children, breeds, coat type, and contact details of the organization housing the pet.

_3. Seamless Integration:_ The application seamlessly integrates with the Petfinder API, ensuring real-time data retrieval and accuracy.

_4. API Integration: _ We utilized the Petfinder API to fetch information about adoptable pets. The API provided us with access to a vast database of animals available for adoption, facilitating our mission to connect users with their potential furry companions.
